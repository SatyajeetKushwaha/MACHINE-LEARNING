        "2  What are the assumptions of linear regression?\n",
        "-Linear regression relies on several key assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of its estimates. These assumptions are:\n",

        "### **1. Linearity**  \n",
        "- The relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (outcome) must be **linear**.  \n",
        "- If the relationship is non-linear, linear regression may not be appropriate or could require transformation (e.g., logarithmic transformation).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Independence (No Autocorrelation)**  \n",
        "- The residuals (errors) should be **independent** of each other.  \n",
        "- In time series data, this means no serial correlation (errors at one time point should not be correlated with errors at another time point).  \n",
        "- **Violation test**: Use the **Durbin-Watson test** to check for autocorrelation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)**  \n",
        "- The variance of residuals should remain **constant** across all levels of the independent variable(s).  \n",
        "- If variance increases or decreases (heteroscedasticity), standard errors may be biased, leading to unreliable statistical tests.  \n",
        "- **Violation test**: Use a **scatter plot of residuals vs. predicted values** or **Breusch-Pagan test**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Normality of Residuals**  \n",
        "- The residuals (errors) should be **normally distributed**, especially for small sample sizes.  \n",
        "- This is important for hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, confidence intervals).  \n",
        "- **Violation test**: Use a **Q-Q plot**, **histogram of residuals**, or **Shapiro-Wilk test**.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **2. Reasons for Using MSE**  \n",
        "#### **a) Penalizes Larger Errors More**  \n",
        "- Squaring the errors **amplifies larger deviations**, making the model more sensitive to outliers.\n",
        "- This ensures that models minimize large prediction errors, leading to better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **b) Differentiable for Optimization**  \n",
        "- The squared function is continuous and differentiable, making it easy to compute gradients for optimization (e.g., in gradient descent for machine learning models).\n",

        "#### **c) Easy to Interpret & Compare**  \n",
        "- MSE provides a simple way to measure how well a model fits the data.\n",

        "### **3. Limitations of MSE**  \n",
        "#### **a) Not in the Same Units as the Target Variable**  \n",
        "- Since MSE squares the errors, its unit is **different** from the original variable.  \n",
        "- Solution: Use **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to convert it back to the original unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **b) Sensitive to Outliers**  \n",

        "\n",
        "### **4. Alternatives to MSE**  \n",
        "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Uses absolute values instead of squares, making it less sensitive to outliers.  \n",

        "5 What does an Adjusted R-squared value of 0.85 indicate?\n",
        "-An **Adjusted R-squared** value of **0.85** indicates that **85% of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables** in the regression model, **adjusted for the number of predictors**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Interpretations:**\n",
        "1. **Strong Model Fit**  \n",
        "   - Since **Adjusted \\(R^2\\)** accounts for the number of predictors, an **0.85 value suggests a strong fit**, meaning the independent variables explain most of the variability in the target variable.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Better than Simple \\(R^2\\)**  \n",
        "   - Unlike **\\(R^2\\), which always increases with more variables**, **Adjusted \\(R^2\\) only increases if the new variables contribute meaningful explanatory power**.  \n",
        "   - If the Adjusted \\(R^2\\) remains high, it suggests that most of the predictors in the model are relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Still Some Unexplained Variance**  \n",
        "   - Since Adjusted \\(R^2\\) is **not 1.0**, about **15% of the variance is still unexplained**, meaning there could be other factors affecting the dependent variable that are not included in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What Should You Do Next?**\n",
        "- **Check for overfitting**: Even though 0.85 is high, ensure the model is generalizable by testing on unseen data.  \n",
        "- **Evaluate residuals**: Ensure assumptions like normality and homoscedasticity are met.  \n",
