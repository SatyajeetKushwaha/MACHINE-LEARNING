        "[cite_start]The main goal is to **build a machine learning model to predict cryptocurrency volatility levels** using historical market data[cite: 17]. [cite_start]This prediction is crucial for market participants to manage risk, allocate portfolios, and develop trading strategies[cite: 16]. [cite_start]Volatility refers to the degree of price variation over time, and high volatility can pose significant risks for investors and traders[cite: 15]. [cite_start]The final model should provide insights into market stability by forecasting volatility variations[cite: 19].\n",

        "### **Data & Preprocessing** üßπ\n",
        "[cite_start]The project uses a dataset of historical daily cryptocurrency prices for over 50 cryptocurrencies[cite: 21, 24]. [cite_start]The data includes features like date, symbol, OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices, volume, and market capitalization[cite: 24].\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Required Data Preprocessing Steps**\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Handle missing values** and ensure data consistency[cite: 26].\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Normalize and scale numerical features**[cite: 27].\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Engineer new features** related to volatility and liquidity trends[cite: 28].\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **1. Data Collection & EDA**\n",
        "[cite_start]First, you'll gather the historical OHLC, volume, and market cap data from the provided dataset[cite: 30]. [cite_start]Then, perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data[cite: 32]. [cite_start]This involves analyzing data patterns, trends, correlations, and distributions[cite: 32, 54]. [cite_start]You'll need to create visualizations to summarize dataset statistics and show key trends and correlations[cite: 53, 54].\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Feature Engineering**\n",
        "This is a critical step for improving model performance. You'll create relevant new features, such as:\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Moving averages** [cite: 33]\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Rolling volatility** [cite: 33]\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Liquidity ratios** (e.g., volume/market cap) [cite: 33]\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Technical indicators** (e.g., Bollinger Bands, Average True Range (ATR)) [cite: 33]\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Model Selection & Training**\n",
        "[cite_start]After preparing the data, select an appropriate machine learning model[cite: 34]. Given the time-series nature of the data, suitable models could include:\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Time-series forecasting** models [cite: 34]\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Regression** models [cite: 34]\n",
        "* [cite_start]**Deep learning** approaches [cite: 34]\n",
        "\n",
        "[cite_start]Once a model is selected, train it using the preprocessed dataset[cite: 35].\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. Model Evaluation & Optimization**\n",
        "[cite_start]Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared ($R^2$) score**[cite: 36]. [cite_start]To improve accuracy, perform **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize the model's parameters[cite: 42]. [cite_start]Finally, **test and validate the model on unseen data** to analyze its predictions[cite: 43].\n",
